        <p>In my career in IT, I've gained some experience in Learning Technologies.  I have been a technical trainer, teaching classes in the Adobe suite and Microsoft Office as well as some proprietary systems. My job involved researching individual or depatrment needs, developing courses that meet those needs, delivering them in a classroom or online environment, and distributing evaluations.  For one of my positions, when students had problems getting into or using their Canvas courses, I helped them get access and get oriented in their courses. I also designed many certificates of completion.</p>
        
        <p>I was born and raised in Missouri. I've only lived in a few other states. This may seem like I'd have a limited perspective. But I've lived in college towns and met people from all sorts of backgrounds. I've traveled to other countries and gained insight into people from all over.</p>

        <p>I have a bachelor of general studies from the University of Missouri. General Studies gave me ways to combine theory and practical experience. I am currently enrolled in the learning technologies masters program at the University of Missouri.</p>

       <p>My focus in this class is formalizing my knowledge of learning technologies so I can continue my career as a trainer and help more people be amazing at what they do. In my work, Training is what I've enjoyed the most- helping others learn how to use tools that make their jobs easier has been my guiding principle.</p>
       <p>Throughout the changes in my career, one constant thread has been the desire to make people's work easier, whether it be via one-on-one or group technical training, app development, course design or making web content easier to access and more tailored for individual needs.</p>


<h3>Experience</h3>


<p><b>Educational Technologist, William Woods University </b></p>
<p><em>Reflection</em></p>
<p>In my position at WWU, I administer the Brightspace e-learning platform: I assist students, create course masters, assist faculty in course design, create assignments, designing end-of-semester surveys and reports, and work with publishers to obtain copies of textbooks for instructors. </p> 
<p><em>Major Accomplishments </em></p><p>
I initiated the IT documentation project and designed wiki pages for the documentation of student and instructor help, and internal IT training topics. </p>
 
<p><b>Web developer, e-learning administrator, content management specialist, MU Extension, University of Missouri, http://extension.missouri.edu, November 2014- August 2020 </b></p>
<p><em>Reflection </em></p>
<p>I designed from-scratch HTML and CSS website layouts and worked a graphic designer to incorporate their designs. I also developed JavaScript web content and .NET web apps. I trained staff in web content management, video production, and use of social media. For MU Extension Facebook accounts, I set up shared pages and scheduled their posts. </p>
create assignments, designing end-of-semester surveys and reports, and work with publishers to obtain copies of textbooks for instructors. </p> 
<p><em>Major Accomplishments </em></p>
<p>Our website experienced a major conversion to a content management system in 2016. I learned the new system and trained staff all over the state of Missouri in the use of the new platform. Also, during the pandemic shutdown, I created a training department and initiative to train nearly 200 support staff throughout the state in various work-from-home tasks such as hosting and participating in Zoom sessions, use of Microsoft Excel to keep office books, graphic design for office managers and video production training for field agents. </p>
