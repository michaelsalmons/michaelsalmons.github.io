		<h3>About</h3>
		<p> Hello! My name is <b>Michael Salmons</b>. I have a background in Educational Technology and technical training. I am a graduate student studying Learning Technologies at the University of Missouri with an emphasis on Instructional Technologies. My expected graduation date in Summer of 2022. After graduation I plan to continue pursuing a career in Educational Technology. I am passionate about helping people learn to do the things that will help them be their best. <br />I live in Columbia, MO with my wife and children and a very energetic Jack Russell Terrier. </p>
		<blockquote>Experience isn't <em>everything</em>, but it <em>helps</em>.</blockquote>
		
		<p>I have worked for many years in the IT field, in the sub-disciplines of server administration, desktop computer support, web development, media development, training, and application developer. As a technical trainer I designed and taught classes in the Adobe and Microsoft Office suites. I have also designed Canvas courses as well as serving as administrator and technical support for faculty. When students had problems getting into or using their courses, I helped them get access and get oriented in their courses. I have also designed course certificates in Canvas Catalog. Eventually I realized my real passion was training and education and made the decision to get my Masterâ€™s degree in Learning Technologies. </p>
