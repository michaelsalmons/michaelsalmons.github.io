    Hello! My name is Michael Salmons. I have a background in Educational Technology and technical training. I became a graduate student studying Instructional Technology at the University of Missouri in order to be the best trainer and technologist I can be. I am passionate about helping people learn to do the things that will help them be their best, too. I live in Columbia, MO with my wife and children and a very active Jack Russell Terrier. </body>
