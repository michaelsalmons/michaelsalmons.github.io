    <h3>About Me</h3>
    
    <p>Greetings! My name is Michael Salmons. I'd like to share with you some details about me and my background.<br /> As an undergraduate, I pursued an interdisciplinary degree in Art, Art History and Anthropology. But life had other plans. To start a family, I stopped going to college  and eventually started a career in the IT field. In my work, I've I gained some experience in Learning Technologies.  I have been a technical trainer, teaching classes in the <strong>Adobe suite</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>. I have also helped students with <strong>Canvas courses</strong>. When students have problems getting into or using their courses, I have helped them get access and get oriented in their courses. I have also designed course certificates in Canvas Catalog.</p>
    
    <blockquote><em>Experience isn't everything, but it helps.</em></blockquote>

    <p>Later, I decided to go back and finish my degree. After I finished, I realized my real passion was training and education and made the decision to get my Master’s degree in Learning Technologies. </p>

    <p>In my private time, I enjoy music and art.  My wife and I have three amazing kids. We share our lives with a small but mighty Jack Russell terrier.</p>
