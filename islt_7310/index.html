        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>My name is Michael Salmons. Welcome to my professional portfolio site. I designed it to show you two sides of my development.  One side is my work in the Information Technology field. The other side is my personal work. I have research interests. Some of them overlap with my work experience. Others are more about expressing myself. I think showing both sides is important. I hope it gives you a more complete picture of who I am.</p>
