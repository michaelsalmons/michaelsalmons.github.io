<p>My name is Michael, and I'm a returning student. I stopped going to college to get into the IT field.  Later, I decided to go back and finish my degree. After I finished, I decided to get my Masterâ€™s degree in Learning Technologies. I have some practical experience in this field. I am a technical trainer, teaching classes in the Adobe suite and Microsoft Office. I also help with Canvas courses. One of my jobs is writing the code parts of courses. When students have problems getting into or using their courses, I help them. I design course certificates in Canvas Catalog. In my private time, I enjoy music and art.  My wife and I have three amazing kids. We share our lives with a small but mighty Jack Russell terrier.</p>
